      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how PixelMinds Solutions LTD ("we", "us",
        "our") collects, uses, discloses and protects personal data about you
        when you visit our website or contact us. It also explains your rights
        and how to exercise them. This policy follows principles in line with
        the UK Data Protection Act and ICO guidance.
      </p>

      <h2>Data controller</h2>
      <p>
        PixelMinds Solutions LTD is the data controller. For queries about this
        policy or to exercise your rights, contact: <a href="mailto:privacy@pixelminds.co.uk">privacy@pixelminds.co.uk</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Personal data we collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Contact information you provide directly (e.g. name, email, company).</li>
        <li>Communications and support correspondence (messages you send us).</li>
        <li>Technical data collected automatically (IP address, browser, device, page views) — only where you have given consent for analytics cookies.</li>
        <li>Any other information you choose to provide in forms or emails.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How we use your personal data</h2>
      <p>We use personal data for the following purposes and on these lawful bases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> to provide services or respond to enquiries.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal compliance:</strong> to comply with legal obligations.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> to operate and improve our website and business, where those interests are not overridden by your rights.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> where you have given consent for analytics/marketing cookies; you can withdraw consent at any time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sharing and third parties</h2>
      <p>
        We may share personal data with trusted service providers acting as
        processors (for example: analytics providers, email services, hosting)
        to perform services on our behalf. We require contracts to ensure they
        follow security and data protection obligations. We do not sell your
        personal data. Where required by law, we may disclose data to comply
        with legal obligations, regulatory requests or to protect rights.
      </p>

      <h2>International transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Some processors we use may transfer data outside the UK. Where this
        occurs we will put appropriate safeguards in place (e.g. standard
        contractual clauses) or rely on an adequacy decision where applicable.
      </p>

      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes set
        out above and in accordance with applicable law. For example, consent
        cookies are retained for the duration stated in the Cookie Policy.
      </p>

      <h2>Your rights</h2>
      <p>You have a number of rights under data protection law, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Right of access</strong> — request a copy of personal data we hold about you.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to rectification</strong> — request correction of inaccurate personal data.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to erasure</strong> — ask us to delete your personal data in certain circumstances.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to restriction</strong> — request the restriction of processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to object</strong> — object to processing based on legitimate interests or direct marketing.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to portability</strong> — receive your data in a structured, commonly used format when applicable.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to withdraw consent</strong> — where processing is based on consent, you can withdraw it at any time without affecting processing prior to withdrawal.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To exercise any of these rights contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@pixelminds.co.uk">privacy@pixelminds.co.uk</a>.
        We will respond within one month unless the request is complex, in
        which case we may extend by a further two months and notify you.
      </p>
